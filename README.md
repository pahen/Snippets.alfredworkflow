This workflow for [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com/) will search you snippets from the application [Snippets](http://www.snippetsapp.com/). It's not required to have Snippets running since it will search the data storage (XML file) directly.

## Usage

![](https://github.com/pahen/Snippets.alfredworkflow/raw/master/img/search.png)

```ENTER``` = Copy to clipboard

```CMD + ENTER``` = Copy & paste

```ALT + ENTER``` = View as Large Type

You can also create new snippets from a text selection anywhere by pressing ```CTRL + ALT + CMD + S```.

## TODO

Add support for searching on multiple keywords separated with space.
